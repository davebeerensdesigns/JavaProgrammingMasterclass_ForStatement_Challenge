# The for Statement Challenge Exercise

Create a prime number counter variable, that will keep count of how many prime numbers were found.

Create a for statement, using any range of numbers, where the maximum number is <= 1000.

For each number in the range:
- Check to see if it's a prime number using the isPrime method. 
- If the number is prime, print it out and increment the prime number counter variable. 
- Once the prime number counter equals three, exit the loop (Hint, use the break statement to exit).
